# Data

In this folder, you should download .nc files from [NOAA's ERDDAP](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/files/erdMWchla1day/).

The **01_NOAA_Chlorophyll_Plotting.ipynb** jupyter notebook can generate plots for all the data files you have saved in this directory, and will output a plot with the same name to the plots folder (the .nc file extension will be replaced with .png)`
